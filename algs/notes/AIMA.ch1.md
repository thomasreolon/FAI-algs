# Chapter 1

The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) attempts not just to understand (logic, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, ...), but also to build intelligent entities (computer science, mathematics, engineering, ...).

Two ways for creating intelligenge: imitating nature or building it from scratches.

- **Thinking humanly**: imitate the human mind (cognitive science) (Turing test)

- **Thinking rationallly**: logic & algorithms (problems: np-hard, how to represent informal knowledge)

### Agents

Agents are programs that try to behave intelligently taking the best actions to achieve their goals.

Nowadays agents are tipically weak-narrow AI. This book explains how to build them.

- WEAK: seems intelligent; STRONG: is intelligent
- GENERAL: can do many tasks; NARROW: only one task

### History

**1950**: Alang Turing & roots of AI
**1958**: McCarthy & LISP
**1969**: Minsky & 1st AI winter (1 hidden layer cannot create XOR)
**1980'**: researchers have a more scientific approach (statistic)
**2001**: big data
**2015**: deep learning & computational power
